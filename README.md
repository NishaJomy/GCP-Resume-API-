# GCP-Resume-API-
Pick Your Cloud Playground: The Cloud Resume API Challenge supports AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure. Pick a provider that you like best!

Design Your Data: Think about what information your resume API will include. Start with the basics like your name, contact details, experience, and skills. You can always expand later!

Store your Resume Data: Use the NoSQL Database within your selected cloud provider to store your resume data in JSON.

Time to Code: Your core component will be a serverless function. This function is responsible for fetching your resume data from the database and crafting a response for anyone who uses your API.

Deploy to Cloud: Deployment is the process that makes your API accessible over the internet.

Test Drive Your API: Once your API is deployed, you (or anyone else!) can send a request and see your resume displayed in a structured JSON format.
